- **Texturing**: Material creation using Substance Painter and procedural textures in Maya.
- **Lighting & Rendering**: Scene setup, lighting with Arnold, and optimized rendering.
- **Animation**: Character and object animations, rigging, and blend shapes.

Feel free to explore each project folder to view the project files, renders, and animations!
